# Supervised Learning

### What is Supervised Learning?

Supervised learning is a machine learning paradigm. In this scenario, the computer receives example inputs and corresponding desired outputs provided by a "teacher," aiming to learn a general rule that establishes a mapping between the inputs and outputs. Or, in other words, the training data fed to the training algorithm includes desired solutions, called **labels**.&#x20;

#### Typical supervised learning tasks are:

* Classification
* Regression (& classification via regression - logistic regression)

# Reinforcement Learning

### What is Reinforcement Learning?

Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning focusing on how intelligent agents make decisions to maximize a **cumulative reward**.&#x20;

An agent takes actions based on its current state within an environment and receives rewards or penalties in return. Through this process, the agent develops a policy which is a strategy for maximizing rewards over time.

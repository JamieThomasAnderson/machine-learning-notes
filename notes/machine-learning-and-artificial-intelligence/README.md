# Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence

### **What is Machine Learning?**

Machine learning is a sub field of artificial intelligence (AI) emerging from the goal of developing intelligent systems. In ordinary programming paradigms, an implementation explicitly details the solution. Using machine learning, models use data to identify patterns which can generalise to unseen cases. As a result, we use machine learning when the problem is too hard or impossible to solve through algorithmic solutions. In this way, learning algorithms work under the assumption that past strategies, algorithms, and inferences that worked in the past will work in the future.

While we can define machine learning in any number of ways, as Tom Mitchell defines in his 1997 book _Machine Learning and as_ GÃ©ron reinforces:

* _A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E - Tom Mitchell, 1997._\


According to Mitchell's definition, a computer program learns when its performance on a task improves as it gains experience. The experience refers to the data it learns from, the task is what it aims to accomplish, and the performance measure assesses how well it performs the task.

### **Machine Learning Landscape**

Now that we understand that machine learning involves the development of models using learning algorithms and training data to generalise solutions, we can broadly categorise different forms of machine learning. We can separate machine learning systems by their learning paradigm - or the level of supervision during training:&#x20;

* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning
* Reinforcement Learning

Again, we can further delineate between machine learning approaches based on their learning mode (online versus batch learning) and learning methodology (instance-based versus model-based).

# Semi-supervised Learning

### What is Semi-supervised Learning?

Semi-supervised learning is a machine learning paradigm. Labelling vast amounts of data can be time-consuming. So, we often have datasets with some labelled and non-labelled data - often more unlabelled. Semi-supervised learning models deal with this type of information.

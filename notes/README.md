# Introduction

The following notes discuss my understanding of machine learning topics and thus are not an exhaustive or comprehensive resource. [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/) is the primary reference material, but I occasionally lean on complementary resources. I hope these insights can provide additional value and offer alternative perspectives for those who engage with them.

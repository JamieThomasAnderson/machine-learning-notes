# Transfer Learning

### What is Transfer Learning?

Transfer learning is a machine learning technique that applies the knowledge acquired from one task or domain to a different but related task or domain. Rather than beginning from scratch, this approach utilizes a pre-trained model, typically trained on a large dataset, as a foundation. By leveraging the learned representations and knowledge from the pre-trained model, transfer learning enables improved performance, faster training, and enhanced generalization on the target task, even with limited labelled data.

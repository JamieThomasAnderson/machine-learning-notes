# Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is the process of extracting raw features, characteristics or attributes from raw data using domain knowledge.

Feature engineering involves the following steps:

1. Feature selection: Selecting the most useful features to train among total features within a domain.
2. Feature extraction: Combining select features to produce a more meaningful metric. -- see. dimensionality reduction.
3. Creating new features by gathering new data.
